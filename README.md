# Habit Tracker
# Overview
Habit Tracker is a Python-based app designed to help users track and analyze their habits over time. The users renovate an old, dusty palace by tracking their habits. As users successfully track their habits, the palace's decorations gain experience points (EXP) and transform, leading to the complete renovation of the palace.

# Features
- **Mind Palace:** Choose decorations for each habit, and as you track your progress, the decorations gain EXP and upgrade from "Old" to "Great", helping to renovate the palace.
- **Habit Management:** Create, edit, and delete habits with associated decorations.
- **Progress and Analytics:** Track your current and longest streaks and fails for each habit.
- **Butler Assistant:** An in-app assistant provides analytics, motivation, and guidance on your progress.
- **CLI Navigation:** The app is operated through a Command-Line Interface (CLI), where you can navigate using numbers/keys.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ``git clone https://github.com/elio-kun/habit-tracker-app.git``

   ``cd habit-tracker``

3. **Run the application:**
   Navigate to the 'src' directory and run the __main__.py script:
